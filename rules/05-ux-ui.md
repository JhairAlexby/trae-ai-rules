UX/UI Rules

1. Purpose: Define goal/user first. One primary CTA. Delete useless screens.

2. Content: No "Lorem ipsum". Use descriptive labels (e.g., "Pay Now", not "Submit").

3. States: Design loading, empty, error, success. Give immediate feedback.

4. Safety: Provide "Undo"/"Cancel". Validate inline. Confirm destructive acts.

5. Hierarchy: Title > Subtitle > Content > CTA. Group by task. Reduce memory load.

6. A11y: Visible focus. Labels on inputs. Min touch target 48dp.

7. Mobile: Mobile layout first. Clear navigation/breadcrumbs.

8. Consistency: Reuse patterns/components. Stick to design system.

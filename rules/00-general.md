1. Pure rendering: No side effects while building the view.

2. Top-level hooks: Use state functions only at the start of the component.

3. Separate concerns: Keep UI, logic, and data in different sections.

4. Strong typing: Avoid generic data types. Validate all external info.

5. Reusability: Create shared functions for repeated processes.

6. Clear naming: Uppercase for components, lowercase for functions.

7. Centralized API: Keep network requests outside of the UI design.

8. Error handling: Always catch failures and show alerts to the user.

9. Derived state: Do not duplicate data that can be calculated from another.

10. Performance: Load heavy files only when they are strictly needed.

11. Accessibility: Use labels for buttons, images, and page titles.

12. Clean structure: Avoid circular calls and verify before deleting code.

13. Standards: Follow system rules and always use pnpm as the manager.
